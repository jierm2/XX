To develop a better understanding of the relationships between different property metrics and ideally leverage those relationships to predict property valuation factors such as price, condition, and features.


Yes, they just listed on the introduction ppt.  For the first research set, they used box plot, and calculated  summary statistics and they found  median and IQR. 
For the second research set, they did sample statistics, 95% confidence interval, hypothesis test. 
For the third research set, they fitted a linear regression model, checked multiple linear regression conditions, and ran prediction on sample house data.
For the fourth research set, they splitted the data and did a parsimonious model, and used roc and auc, and found a predictive threshold.

Homes that sold in normal condition and that have central air conditioning typically sold for a greater price than those homes that did not have central air conditioning. Their model does a good job in predicting whether or not a house will have central air conditioning.

Iâ€™m wondering how they used median and IQR in their analysis.
